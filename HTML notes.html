		< ! D O C T Y P E  h t m l >should be at the top of every HTMl document to indicate to the browser what kind of document it is<br />
		< h 1 >anything< / h 1 > creates a header. In this case, anything would be the header of the website. They can be used to capture the readers attention or to give information<br />
		< h 1 > is usually the main header and < h 2 >, < h 3 >, < h 4 >, etc. are used for sub-sections.<br />
		< h e a d > and < / h e a d> are tags for the metadata of a website. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the web page.<br /> 
		-- They should be right after the first < h t m l > tag. <br />
		< t i t l e > and < / t i t l e > are used to create the title of the webpage. It is what you see on the tab of a webpage. It goes in the head tags. <br />
		Anything between the opening < h t m l > and closing < / h t m l > tags will be interpreted as HTML code <br />
		<div>
		<h2> Text, Images, and Videos<h2/>
		< b o d y > and < / b o d y > are tags used to put content in a website. For example images or text.<br />
		using < p > and < / p > are tags used to create paragraphs <br />
		< b r / > is a self-closing tag that does a line break when inserted in code.<br />
		You need to indent code properly so that it is easy to read<br />
		The < ! - - and - - > are tags that allow you to comment to allow the reader to understand what the code means<br />
		< d i v >s can contain any text or other HTML elements. They are primarily used to divide HTML documents into sections.<br />
		< s p a n >s contain short pieces of text or other HTML. They are primarily used to wrap small pieces of content that are on the same line as other content and do not break text into different sections.<br />
		The < e m > tag will generally render as italic emphasis.< s t r o n g > will generally render as bold emphasis.<br />
		The < u l > tag allows you to make an unordered list but, it does not have any words in it. To put words in the list, they need to be surrounded by < l i > and < / l i >.<br />
			<h3>Lists</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>html</li>
					<li>CSS</li>
					<li>Javascript</li>
				</ul>
		The < o l > tag allows you to create an ordered list which is the same as an unordered list but it is numbered list.<br />
			The < i m g > tag has a required attribute called "src". The "src" attribute must be set to the image's source, or the location of the image.<br />
		In this case, the value of src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image<br>
		The alt attribute allows you to add a description to an image to know what the image is if it doesn't load. It can also makethe computer read the description out loud.<br />
		he < v i d e o > tag works just like the < i m g > tag. The "src" must link to a file and not a video on another website. You need a width and size attribute for the size of the video on the website.<br />
		You also need a controls attribute to make the video have the usual video attributes.<br />
		<div>
		<h2> Links</h2>
		Links can be inserted in a website with the < a > tag. You also need a href element between the tags to insert the url.. <br />
		You can add links to images by wrapping the image tag with < a > tags.<br />
		The target allows you to make the link create a new browser window.<br />
		You can create sections on a webpage and jump to them using < a > tags and addings ids to the elements you wish to jump to.<br />
		The nav element contains links to internal pages or content.<br />
		<h2>Tables</h2>
		The < t a b l e > allows you to create tables.<br/>
		< tr > allows you to put rows in your tables. <br/>
		< t d > is what allows you to insert content inside the cells in a row<br/>
		< t h > is a tag used to put headings in tables.<br/>
		You can use the colspan attribute to make the cell in a table longer<br/>
		You can use the rowspan attribute to make a cell in a table deeper<br/>
