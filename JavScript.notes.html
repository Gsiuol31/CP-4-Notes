		<h1> Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
		<p>The console is a tool that developers use to record the output of their JavaScript programs<br>
		The console.log() command is used to print, or log, text to the console<br>
		Data types are the building blocks of all languages and essential pieces of any program.<br>
		Primitive data types lay the foundation for all JavaScript programs. <br>
		Null — Can only be null. It represents the absence of value.<br>
		Booleans — Either true or false, with no quotations. In the example above, true is a boolean.<br>
		Numbers — Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 1516, .002, 23.42. In the example above, 40.7 is a number.<br>
		Strings — Any grouping of keyboard characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes ('Hello') or double quotes ("World!"). <br>
		In the example above, 'New York City' is a string.<br>
		It would look like this, console.log('New York City')<br>
		You can also use JavaScript for math.<br>
		For example, console.log(3 + 4)<br>
		Four essential data types in JavaScript include strings, numbers, booleans, and null.<br>
		Data is printed, or logged, to the console with console.log().<br>
		Four built-in mathematical operators include +, -, *, and /.<br>
		JavaScript associates certain properties with different data types.<br>
		JavaScript has built-in methods for different data types.<br>
		Libraries are collections of methods that can be called without an instance.<br>
		You can write single-line comments with // and multi-line comments between /* and */.<br></p>
		<h1> Variables</h1>
		<p>There are two types of variables: const and let</br>
		Const creates a variable that cannot change</br>
		Variables hold reusable data in a program.</br>
		JavaScript will throw an error if you try to reassign const variables.</br>
		You can reassign variables that you create with the let keyword.</br>
		Unset variables store the primitive data type undefined.</br>
		Mathematical assignment operators make it easy to calculate a new value and assign it to the same variable.</br>
		The + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.</br>
		In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a string.</br></p>
		<h1>Control Flow</h1>
		<p>if/else statements make binary decisions and execute different code based on conditions.<br>
		All conditions are evaluated to be truthy or falsy.<br>
		We can add more conditional statements to if/else statements with else if.<br>
		switch statements make complicated if/else statements easier to read and achieve the same result.<br>
		The ternary operator (?) and a colon (:) allow us to refactor simple if/else statements.<br>
		Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, and >= can compare two variables or values.<br>
		After two values are compared, the conditional statement evaluates to true or false.<br>
		The logical operator && checks if both sides of a condition are truthy.<br>
		The logical operator || checks if either side is truthy.<br>
		The logical operator !== checks if the two sides are not equal.<br>
		An exclamation mark (!) switches the truthiness / falsiness of the value of a variable.<br>
		One equals symbol (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.<br>
		Three equals symbols (===) are used to check if two variables are equal to each other.<br></p>
		<h1>Functions</h1>
		<p>Functions are written to perform a task.<br>
		Functions take data, perform a set of tasks on the data, and then return the result.<br>
		We can define parameters to be used when calling the function.<br>
		When calling a function, we can pass in arguments, which will set the function's parameters.<br>
		We can use return to return the result of a function which allows us to call functions anywhere, even inside other functions.<br></p>
		<h1> Scope </h1>
		<p>Scope is the idea in programming that some variables are accessible/inaccessible from other parts of the program.<br>
		Global Scope refers to variables that are accessible to every part of the program.<br>
		Block Scope refers to variables that are accessible only within the block they are defined.<br></p>
