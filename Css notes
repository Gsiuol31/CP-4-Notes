		<h1> Intro and Styling </h1>
		<p>CSS is used to design a website.<br />
			You can use the style attribute to design text. You can change the color, font size, font family and other things.<br />
			Each style needs to be separated ny a semi-colon.<br />
			To design many of the same elements, you need to open a < s t y l e > attribute in the < h e a d > element.<br />
			For example, you can make it so that every h1 element is the same color in a < s t y l e > element. </p><br />
		<h1> Linking an HTML document to a CSS Document </h1>
		<p>	You need to link your html file to a css file to make it easier to read. You can do this with a < l i n k > tag and with href, type, and rel attributes.<br />
			For example, < link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"><p><br />
		<h1> Classes </h1>
			<p> Classes can be used to style a certain attribute of a text.<br />
				For example, .title would style every title in the text.
				CSS classes are meant to be reused over many elements
				You can add classes to make it easier to code in the future.
				For example, if u create a class called green and in it, it makes the font green.<br />
				Then if u make an h1, and do  < h1 class="green">Top Vacation Spots< / h 1 >, it will be green.<br />
		<h1> IDs </h1>
			<p>If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely (no matter what classes are applied to the element), we can add an ID to the element<br/>
			#large-title {
				font-family: cursive;
				Text-transform: capitalize;
			}
		<h1> Specify </h1>
			<p>Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed.
			IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, tags.
			So, for example, classes take priority over tags.
