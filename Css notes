		<h1> Intro and Styling </h1>
		<p>CSS is used to design a website.<br />
			You can use the style attribute to design text. You can change the color, font size, font family and other things.<br />
			Each style needs to be separated ny a semi-colon.<br />
			To design many of the same elements, you need to open a < s t y l e > attribute in the < h e a d > element.<br />
			For example, you can make it so that every h1 element is the same color in a < s t y l e > element. </p><br />
		<h1> Linking an HTML document to a CSS Document </h1>
		<p>	You need to link your html file to a css file to make it easier to read. You can do this with a < l i n k > tag and with href, type, and rel attributes.<br />
			For example, < link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"><p><br />
		<h1> Classes </h1>
			<p> Classes can be used to style a certain attribute of a text.<br />
				For example, .title would style every title in the text.<br>
				CSS classes are meant to be reused over many elements.<br>
				You can add classes to make it easier to code in the future.<br>
				For example, if u create a class called green and in it, it makes the font green.<br />
				Then if u make an h1, and do  < h1 class="green">Top Vacation Spots< / h 1 >, it will be green.<br />
		<h1> IDs </h1>
			<p>If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely (no matter what classes are applied to the element), we can add an ID to the element<br/>
			#large-title {<br>
				font-family: cursive;<br>
				Text-transform: capitalize;<br>
			}<br>
		<h1> Specify </h1>
			<p>Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles will be displayed.<br>
			IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, tags.<br>
			So, for example, classes take priority over tags.<br>
			You can have more than 1 selector for each element.<br>
			Elements can be nested into classes.<br>
			!important takes priority over any class and therefore should almost never be used.<br>
			Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.<br>
		<h1> CSS structure </h1>
			<p> CSS declarations are property and values.<br>
			For example, color: teal<br>
			Font-family is for font<br>
			Font-size is for the size of the font<br>
			Font-weight is the thickness of the text<br>
			Text-align is where the text is on the page<br>
			Color can be used to change the text color or the background color<br>
			The opacity is the transparency of the element<br>
			.background-image allows you to put an image in the background of somenthing.<br>
			You need to put a url that leads to an image<br>
		<h1> The Box Model </h1>
			<p> Each website is a box<br>
			If you change the background of a website, you change the background of the box<br>
			There are properties that defines part of the box model.<br>
			Weight and height define the size of the content area<br>
			Padding specifies the amount of space between the border and the content<br>
			Border specifies the thickness and style of the border surrounding the content<br>
			Margin specifies the space between the border and the outside dge of the element<br>
