			CSS is used to design a website.<br />
			You can use the style attribute to design text. You can change the color, font size, font family and other things.<br />
			Each style needs to be separated ny a semi-colon.<br />
			To design many of the same elements, you need to open a < s t y l e > attribute in the < h e a d > element.<br />
			For example, you can make it so that every h1 element is the same color in a < s t y l e > element. <br />
			You need to link your html file to a css file to make it easier to read. You can do this with a < l i n k > tag and with href, type, and rel attributes.<br />
